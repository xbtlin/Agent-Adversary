# Agent-Adversary: Phase 3 - Scale & Ecosystem

## Goals
Transform from a standalone tool into a comprehensive benchmarking ecosystem.

## Planned Features
1. **Agent-to-Agent Battle Royale**: Scenarios where two agents compete to exploit each other.
2. **Dockerized Sandboxing**: Run target agents in isolated containers for safe jailbreak testing.
3. **API Connector Hub**: Pre-built connectors for popular agent APIs (OpenAI Assistants, Anthropic Computer Use, etc.).
4. **Cloud Benchmark Hosting**: A web portal to share and compare resilience scores.
5. **Auto-Mitigation Suggestions**: Use the judge model to suggest code/prompt fixes for discovered vulnerabilities.

## Timeline
- **Hour 11-13**: Sandboxing & API Connectors.
- **Hour 14-15**: Multi-agent scenarios.
- **Hour 16+**: Ecosystem & Community features.
