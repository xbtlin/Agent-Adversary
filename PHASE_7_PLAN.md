# Agent-Adversary: Phase 7 - Resilience & Formal Testing

## Goals
Ensure the reliability of the framework itself through formal testing and prepare for complex real-world integrations.

## Planned Features
1. **Formal Test Suite**: Implement `pytest`-based unit and integration tests for all core modules (Engine, Evaluator, Connectors).
2. **Mock Server Improvements**: Enhance the mock server to simulate complex rejection patterns for better adaptive attack testing.
3. **Integration with OpenClaw/Claude Code**: Create specific connectors/templates for the most popular agentic frameworks.
4. **Agent-to-Agent Battle Royale (Scalability)**: Optimize the battle engine for concurrent interactions between multiple agents.
5. **Security Hardening**: Audit the code for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., shell injection in connectors).

## Timeline
- **Hour 51-53**: Formal Testing & Bug squashing.
- **Hour 54-56**: Real-world integration templates.
- **Hour 57+**: Battle Royale scalability and security audit.
