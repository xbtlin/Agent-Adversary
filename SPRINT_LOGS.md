    - Implemented a baseline `JudgeModel` for LLM-based evaluation.
    - Created a functional CLI with `bench` and `list` commands.
    - Verified the end-to-end flow with simulated agents.
    - **(Phase 2 Complete)**: 
        - Implemented `ReasoningTrapGenerator` and added multi-turn logic traps.
        - Implemented `BrowserConnector` using Playwright for web-based agent testing.
        - Enhanced `AdversaryEngine` with structured evaluation flow and `BenchmarkReport` generator.
        - Polished CLI (`main.py`) with rich table outputs, progress spinners, and browser connector support.
        - Published `GALLERY.md` showcasing real-world logic traps.
        - Updated `README.md` with high-quality SVG architecture diagrams and full Phase 2 capabilities.
        - Finalized code documentation and created a sample report for demonstration.
- **Thought**: The project has reached its technical maturity. It covers CLI, Web, and logic-based testing—a unique niche in the AI agent market.
- **(Phase 3 Complete)**:
    - Implemented initial `DockerSandboxConnector` for secure, isolated agent testing.
    - Added `OpenAIAssistantConnector` to support testing OpenAI-based agents via the Assistants API.
    - Developed `BattleRoyaleEngine` prototype for Agent-to-Agent adversarial scenarios.
    - Built `MitigationAdvisor` to provide automated fix suggestions for detected vulnerabilities.
    - Implemented `CloudUploader` for sharing benchmark results to a central portal.
    - Verified the end-to-end integration of Phase 3 modules.
- **(Wrap-up)**:
    - Conducted final code cleanup and docstring optimization.
    - Updated `README.md` to reflect full Phase 3 ecosystem capabilities (Docker, API, Battle Royale, Mitigation).
    - Final project inspection completed. Ready for public launch.
- (Phase 4 Started):
    - Built `Observability` suite including `TelemetryManager` and `ResourceMonitor`.
    - Integrated real-time telemetry logging into `AdversaryEngine`.
    - Implemented `SwarmOrchestrator` to enable multi-agent coordination testing.
    - Added `SwarmScenarios` targeting cascading hallucinations and circular deadlocks.
    - Implemented `PrometheusExporter` and `GrafanaDashboardGenerator` for enterprise monitoring.
    - Developed `LivePatcher` to enable real-time prompt hotfixing during exploit detection.
    - Extended CLI with `observe` and `export` commands, and added `--telemetry`/`--patch` flags to `bench`.
- **(Phase 5 Complete)**:
    - Implemented `AutonomousGenerator` to dynamically create tailored exploits using GPT-4o.
    - Extended CLI with the `generate` command for self-evolving adversarial testing.
    - Restored core data models and refined the `ScenarioLibrary` for dynamic extensibility.
    - Developed `Web Dashboard Backend` using FastAPI to serve telemetry and session data via API.
    - Implemented `ConsensusJudge` to aggregate evaluations from multiple LLM models, reducing scoring bias.
    - Created `CI/CD Integration templates` for GitHub Actions to automate resilience testing.
    - Built `RedTeamRLHarness` prototype for training adversarial agents using Reinforcement Learning.
    - Created a `Static Web Dashboard` UI for real-time monitoring of sessions and benchmarks.
    - Implemented a concrete `RedTeamAgent` for autonomous exploit generation.
- **(Phase 6 Complete)**:
    - Drafted `PHASE_6_PLAN.md` focusing on Multi-Modal red-teaming and Adaptive Exploitation.
    - Implemented `VLMConnector` scaffolding to support vision-based agent testing.
    - Added `MultiModalLibrary` with OCR-based and deceptive chart injection scenarios.
    - Developed `AdaptiveAttackOrchestrator` to enable iterative, feedback-driven exploitation attempts.
    - Implemented `ProfessionalReportExporter` for branded HTML security audit reports.
    - Built `ScenarioPluginManager` for dynamic YAML/JSON scenario loading.
    - Integrated Phase 6 features into the CLI (`audit` and `plugins` flag).
- **(Phase 7 Started)**:
    - Initiated `PHASE_7_PLAN.md` for formal testing and resilience.
    - Created a comprehensive `pytest` suite in `tests/` covering `engine`, `connectors`, `evaluator`, `generator`, `battle`, `observability`, `swarm`, `professional_report`, `consensus`, `security`, and `arena`.
    - Integrated `BattleReferee` into the `BattleRoyaleEngine` for automated outcome analysis.
    - Implemented `test_consensus.py` to verify multi-LLM evaluation logic.
    - Developed `CommandSanitizer` to harden the framework against command injection in connectors.
    - Built native connectors for **OpenClaw**, **Claude Code**, and **Anthropic Computer Use** to enable deep framework integration.
    - Scaled the battle system with the `BattleArena` module for concurrent agent tournaments.
    - Fixed issues in test logic and framework stability; verified all 26 tests passing.
    - Developed framework integration templates for OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Anthropic Computer Use.
- **Thought**: Stability, ease of integration, and scalability are the final hurdles for wide-scale adoption. Phase 7 is addressing all by solidifying the core and lowering the entry barrier.
- **Planned**: Complete the test suite and create templates for OpenClaw/Claude Code integration.
